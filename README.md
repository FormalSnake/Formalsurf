# Formalsurf

![demo](https://github.com/FormalSnake/Formalsurf/blob/main/images/demo.png)

Formalsurf is a simple web browser built using Electron, React and ShadCN!
And I know, it's yet another Electron browser but it is mostly intended for me to practice Electron and React.
If this repository gets enough attention, this _might_ become a full-fledged browser.
